# Event-based-downsampling
Event-based spatio-temporal down-sampling methods and visualisation.

Three down-sampling techniques are presented. Naive - the current incumbent method generally used to down-sample spike-trains, binning and IF (novel methods)
that outperform naive in structural similarity index measures (SSIM).

The newest version of the event-based dowsampling algorithm is available at: https://github.com/anindyaghosh/EvDownsampling.
